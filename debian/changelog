  * fix regression in indexing license text (makes indexing 25% faster)
  * cache app.name whilst indexing
  * remove unused columns from db (icon_color, mimetypes)
  * remove ability to sort alphabetically (not as useful as might seem)
    using the search box is a more powerful approach
    saves 4mb db size and 0.4s+ indexing time
  * full db generation is now sufficiently fast that we only support full db
    generation and not partial generation
  * index rating rather than rating histogram
  * index rating and sort_rating on first iter rather than second
  * pre sort data such that entire database is ordered by rating
    makes indexing 0.7s+ faster and db queries faster too
  * only query app.state once on indexing - saves 0.1s+
  * actually advertise that we accept gzip encoded downloads..
    this gives us 10x smaller review stats download - saves 0.4s+ on indexing
  * shuffle around db so that we query the fts table rather than normal table
    also shuffle around querying code to make it more efficient
    this speeds up indexing a little, reduces db size a little, faster queries
  * also trigger ftable.state update on state change
  * add apt-key for ppa, this now means that those who downloaded the deb file
    should get updates without the untrusted warnings
  * 0.199 causes the db to be 45% smaller than in 0.1.183 and the
    time to generate the db is 50% less than in 0.1.183 :)
